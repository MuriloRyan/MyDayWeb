# MyDayWeb
This project is my first project that includes a database and a python-flask complete structure

> This project has made before I fully undenstand SOLID principles

Now I am focused in implement Solid in my projects

the main technologies (frameworks/libs) that's I was used in the project are:

* Python
* Flask
* Jinja2
* Mongodb

> take a look on requirements.txt to see all dependencies

## Project frontend

The project frontend is a crap ðŸ¤£
yea my frontend skills is no much good (I am training that)

remember the project focus is the database operations and contacts
with jinja2, pymongo and more

I am not a ui designer, I manly focus on backend

## Project security

I has no added a lot of security on the project (yea its no good)
because of I has mainily focused on the database operations

the security methods is manily on the Database in Mongodb

### but...

* I know I must use criptografy like Aes or Rsa and on more critical aplications I use them
* I am using hash algorithms to secure the passwords
* I am blocking strange ip acess to acess the project database
* This project will be modded by me (upgrading mainly the frontend)
